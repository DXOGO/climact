## ClimACT â€“ Future Climate Atlas for Portugal for climate change impact and mitigation research		



Given that this is an exploratory project, its main deliverable will be a Future Climate Atlas for Portugal, a website where all ClimACT climatic data and products will be publicly accessible, to be explored  and used by the scientific community, end-users, decision-makers and  stakeholders to evaluate CC impacts in the sectors most vulnerable to  climate change impacts in Portugal: extreme weather, forest fires, air quality, human health, water resources, renewable energies and agriculture
